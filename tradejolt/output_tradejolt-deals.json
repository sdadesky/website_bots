Since every asset class from bonds to stocks to crypto have soared due to to historically unprecedented increases in the money supply, the financial world is concerned that rising rates will mean plummeting stock and bond markets.\nDescription\nThe financial press is in an uproar about inflation reaching over 6%, higher than in any period in the last 30 years. The FED is now under extreme political pressures to raise short term interest rates. The Fed still believes this inflation is \"transitory\" and due to the disruptions to infrastructure and labor markets resulting from the Covid pandemic. But now they fear that even an inflation lasting 1 or 2 years can cause permanent damage to consumer expectations and become a real problem due to escalation of wage demands. The Democratic administration under Biden is concerned about the impact of this inflation on their voter popularity. Recent voting results in Virginia and elsewhere confirm that trend. They too are putting pressure on the FED to tighten money supply. A majority of economists polled recently have indicated that they expect not only a \"tapering\" of bond buying ('aka a slowdown of money printing') but at least one or two interest rate hikes by June of next year, The most toted figure is an increase of 1/2 percent to short term treasury rates. With S&P price earnings ratios in 2021 at around 25, that half percent interest rate drop could imply that the S&P would need to trade at around 14% lower. What about your 10 year bond fund? That should drop by 5%, which is about double the dividends on those same funds. So what's an investor to do? Especially a conservative one, who needs dividend income now and cannot risk the farm How about investing $200 to make between $500 and $3000 profits between now and July?\nDisclosure: Investing in options and crypto is inherently risky.

The probability that the FED will end tapering sooner and begin interest rate hikes by March is much higher. At price earnings rates at historic highs, we can expect this to be quite bearish for stocks. That's the fundamental picture. From a technical perspective, last November we determined that SPY should peak around $479, having completed an Elliot wave V high, and should begin a correction down that would at least reach $380 by mid-summer 2022. A shorter term chart suggests a drop to $450 by around Jan 13, though it could take a few more days.\nDescription\nWe'll put on a bearish calendar position. For every $25 at risk, we stand to gain a maximum of $375 by the 19th of January. More likely our gains will be in the $150-200 range. At a likely 9x our investment, that's very attractive. We estimate there's about a 30% chance we are wrong. Traders who already have an options account open may purchase our guidance to find out how to accomplish this.

Investors are anticipating a series of tightening measures by the Fed given recent high inflation numbers. Today, we expected and got our \"dead cat bounce\", with a 18 point drop in the SPY, followed by 19 point rally. Is the pain over? I don't think so. There's not only the cloud of the Fed tightening hurting markets, but also a very real possibility of an invasion by Russia of the Ukraine. Some people fear China would take advantage of this move to quickly make a grab for Taiwan. (I don't think so but its not impossible.)\nDescription\nPerhaps these events explain why my charts show SPY headed for $380 over the next half year. Short term, by the end of this week I see today's dead cat bounce culminating at the pivot point of $474 and heading back to retest $420 a second time. This should happen within the week. Check out the graph. By my calculations, SPY should have dropped to $450 (5th wave Elliott), and retraced there. The fact that it kept right on dropping is a very bearish sign. Still when the retrace does happen, you can expect at least $38%, or $441. But it some times overshoots a bit. We have a major pivot point at $447. That my best guess for where this relief rally fades out. From there I expect a quick drop to $420. It might not even pause there but I think it will drop quickly to $412, along the path shown by my blue arrowed lines. So as soon as SPY stalls out on the upward move, perhaps midday tomorrow, I would recommend a bearish option trades that risks $110 to make between $200 and $800. I'd give it slightly better than 50/50 odds. Our guidance is based on an option trade. So make sure you're set up to trade options before considering buying our guidance.

What else can you do, right? \n\nWell, I think I have a solution that you'll like. This combination combines buying a bond that guarantees a very high return in ideal circumstances, with an option that completely hedges that bet if the ideal circumstances don't materialize.  . In the worst case scenario, you'll make about 7% to 8% on your money. In the best case, you can double your money in the event of a large stock market crash.\n\nDescription\n\nWe have you purchase a bond from a \"too big to fail\" bank (citigroup) that pays you  15%,  no matter what happens. From the second year on , the bond pays you a  dividend that is based on 50 times the difference between the interest rate on 2 year treasury bonds and that on 30 year treasury bonds. This return is capped at 15%.\n\nFrom year 2 on, there's a catch. If the 2/30 year treasuries invert  or if the stock market drops by 45% from today's levels, you make nothing in interest for that period! until those situations invert again.  That may sound horrible but it happens infrequently, If the last 80 years of treasury markets history are any guide. Over that period you would have achieve a yield of about 12% including the periods where you make no return at all.  \n\nThat said, I firmly expect the yield curves will invert.  Nor would I be surprised if the stock market drops 50% over the next 2 years.  But this trade hedges to account for that, by using 4-5 percent of the dividend yield to purchase an option that explodes in value if stocks drop.\n\nThis combined investment produces the worst case scenario  if the crash does not happen, and stocks remain slightly negative, flat or up. In that case, the investor will have to swallow a bitter disappointment of only an 8-9% yearly positive return. After all,  that barely matches current inflation! Oh well...\n\nBut if that happens the investor can unload their bond, likely at a premium, since it will be paying about 10 points better than any other safe bond. If the investor chooses not to sell, they will be earning a dividend hovering around 12%-15% for the next 14 years. If you think inflation will permanently lock in at 10%, then this is not the trade for you. I  don't think the high inflation will hold into the downturn I see coming. \n\nNow let's look at performance in the best case scenario for this trade. Say stocks drop 30%-60% this year. The investor collects a sweet 60% to 200% of their principal on the option that has exploded in value.  along with the full 15% dividend.  The bonds will be trading lower - probably around 80 cents on the dollar, maybe as low as 60 cents. Cashing out of all positions is likely to earn the investor between 180% to 260%.\n\nYou might be confused by this combination and I'll admit its complcated.  If so,  I suggest you read my article on Steepener Bonds published on Seeking Alpha a few years ago. (See the forum for the link to this.) \n\nInvestors who want to benefit from this deal should act fast. There are limited numbers of these bonds available. I expect the opportunity to be gone in the next 2-4  weeks. \n\n I'm going to have to do a lot of handholding to investors wanting to follow my guidance on this trade, given that is has two moving parts, So the price for the guidance  is a bit hefty at a  $100. \n\nBefore buying the guidance make sure that \n\nYou agree there's a good likelihood of a market crash and you'd like to benefit (for a change) \nYou can't find a better way to fight inflation without facing big downside risk\nYou already have a financial advisor through which you can  place the trade \nYou already have an options account with the ability to execute calendar options trades.\nDisclosure: Investing in options and crypto is inherently risky.

Or you've gone into a month-long retreat in a Himalayan monastery. I've written a long article on Seeking Alpha explaining the collapse and its many repercussions. \n\n\n\n\nIn the near term Coinbase (COIN) will suffer. This will extend the already severe downturn in the crypto markets. The bulls, if they still are alive,  have retreated deep into their pens, awaiting better times. \n\nDescription\n\n Coinbase relies on crypto transactions for around 90% of its income. Regulatory crackdowns  now make crypto shorting  prohibitive for anyone with less than $10 million in capital. But speculative trading on the bullish side will be hugely diminished for months. The consequence will be a severe reduction of income for Coinbase.\n\nUltimately, I believe COIN will survive this crisis and thrive as one of the only crypto brokerages left standing. But at least for the next half year or so, the future looks very bearish for all cryptos, and thus for COIN.\n\n\nThe graph above shows where that near term bottom is likely to play out (yellow curve). This is a fibonacci projection of the previous two waves, shown in blue.  This will take us down to around $35, at minimum, although the drop could be greater.  This should occur by March of next year, but the time frame could be a few months longer than that. \n\nSince it's almost impossible for US traders to short cryptocurrencies, there's only one easy way to benefit from the downturn I foresee: using options on publicly traded companies that are linked to crypto.\n\nI've fashioned a nice play on COIN. I think it has about an 80% chance of playing out. It bets that COIN will drop to $35 by March, and possibly as late as June of 2023. For every $370 at risk, maximum gains are $1200, with more \"likely\" gains in the $1000 range. If COIN drops even lower than that, or goes bankrupt, investors will make \"only\"  a 50% profit.\n\nIf you wish to purchase guidance for this trade, it will set you back $20. Only do so if you already have an options account set up and can enter into complex trade with defined risk, such as calendar spreads and broken wing butterfly trades.\n\nDisclosure: Investing in options and crypto is inherently risky.

I've fashioned a trade that lets me benefit richly if my expectations play out. For every $300 or so I put a risk, I stand to make as much as $4500-to $5500 within three months. Those are the kinds of odds a man can grow quite fond of...\n\n\n\n\nWhat's the deal, you ask? First, understand that Microstrategy (MSTR) is among the biggest owners of Bitcoin in the world., MSTR recently increased its ownership to 144,000 Bitcoin in April 2023. As a consequence of these massive purchases, MSTR  has become the best proxy on the value of Bitcoin for those who wish to trade options on Bitcoin's future. \n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nCheck out the graph above. We've just cashed in a previous options trade with 500% gains. I believe Bitcoin and MSTR will take a little corrective downturn. As the graph shows, I see MSTR correcting down to around last April's highs, namely around $366. From there I believe we'll see a lot of new money come in, propelling MSTR towards $600. That happens to be a point that corresponds to a fifth wave Elliot point, as well what an RSI tracement (see dotted lines) would indicate. Finally, that's an area of firm overhead resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what factors could cause Bitcoin to surge, and take MSTR with it?  First, Bitcoin's scarcity over time. There are only 21 million units that will ever be minted, and already 19 million of these have been deeply buried into HODLER's private wallets and removed from trading action.  With the Bitcoin halving to occur early next year,  knowledgeable investors know it's time to load the boat.\n\nOne of those, heretofore a Bitcoin sceptic, is none other than Blackrock - only the largest hedge fund on the planet. It has applied for an ETF last month, and if this gets approved over the SEC's known resistance, Bitcoin will got mainstream among public and institutional investors. \n\nIf you think I'm correct, and want to benefit richly, it will cost you $25 to see my guidance of how to play this.  You'll need 3 things: 1) an options trading account already opened, 2) the right to place options trades that use defined risk strategies like calendar and broken-wing butterflies, and at least $300 that you can afford to lose.\n\nIf you need help in setting up a brokerage options account, send me an email.\n\nThe current cost of the trade is $300, but I expect MSTR to drop over the next week, so we may even be able to get in at a price of around $250. Jolt Takers of this deal will of course get guidance from me on the user forum related to the guidance.\n\nIf you took my last trade on MSTR, you've trebled your money. You might want to only play with your winnings, so even if the deal goes South you still have not lost anything.\n\nGood luck to us all!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nl\n\nDisclosure: Investing in options and crypto is inherently risky.

The majority of epidemiologists believe that this virus is here to stay and will require bi-annual or yearly boosts of an ever-evolving vaccine in order to control COVID's deadly impact. A new variant has just emerged in South Africa, which throws another curve at global growth. Demographic trends - with the majority of baby boomers already in retirement or hitting retirement and facing increasing health issues - puts a strong wind at the back of the entire pharmaceutical industry. A leader in this industry, Pfizer's strong COVID business, combined with plus impressive growth in the company's core businesses makes Pfizer aa attractive stock to own for the long term.\nDescription\nAs the chart below shows, we believe PFE will rise to at least $67 over the next 6 -12 months, and should peak out at around $95 over the next 2 years. We've put together a trade that uses options to bet $220 that PFE will rise over the next 9 months. Losses are capped to that but profits could range between $1500 and $280, depending on whether PFE rises to level we expect or much higher than we think is likely.

The fact that the US dollar has been running strong against the Yen was just extra frosting on the cake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\nNow this decade-long trade may be ending. Why? Because he Japanese Yen has been plunging so much, that for the first time in decades Japanese inflation is starting to tick up. According to the EIA, Japan imports around 97% of its oil and gas. Due to the carry trade, Japan's currency has lost 31% of its value against the USD in the last 18 months. This means higher costs on all goods and services linked to energy. \n\n In the last few weeks, the Japanese central bank indicated it would slow down its Yield Curve Controls, which bought long term bonds to keep these from rising higher. This artificially suppressed Japanese rates.  If the central bank continues this practice, Japanese bond rates will rise. The will become more attractive to bondholders vs the US treasury bonds, which carry an currency exchange rate risk. \n\nYet the Japanese are last big buyers of US treasuries among the nations of the world, as other big buyers , such as China and Indiia, have slowed purchases dramatically. The US weaponization of the dollar - seizing Russian assets over the Ukrainian invasion -, the looming trade war with China  not to mention the  as well US governments runaway budgetary deficits, have made foreign central banks very leery of holding dollar assets. \n\nWith the Fed now worried about US inflation and slowing its QE purchases of Treasuries,  another support for the US treasury bonds is eroding. \n\nThese are the factors propelling 20 year US tresuries, and the shares of its proxy ETF, TLT. to greater lows.  Look on the included graph.  TLT is retesting its critical pivot point  at $98.58 for the 2nd time in the last year. With global and economic events evolving as they are, I think it will break through that resistance. From there we'll see a drop over the next 1 to 4  months in three waves down to $95, $90 and finally $84. Those are based on my Fibonacci projections. \n\nIf I'm correct, TLT need not move any lower, and enjoys huge buying support at that price level. \n\nI've worked out an options trade that uses a sophisticated calendar trade. For each $270 you put at risk, you stand to make between $500 and $1500 over a four month period.. If you'd like the details of the trade, the guidance will cost you $25.00.  Only buy the guidance if you already are set up to trade options. \n\nI expect you'll have about 1 or possibly 2 weeks to put on this trade, at even more favorable terms, possibly in the $180-200 range, So be sure to follow the associated blog posts. \n\n\n\n\nAddendum\tStatus Date\tMiniGraph\nSince publishing this deal, Fitch lowered its rating on US bonds for the second time in the last 100 years, from AAA to AA+. If investors were not paying attention to the US government's rapidly deteriorating balance sheet, this put the spot light on it.  We did not get the dead-cat bounce we'd been expecting, and TLT immediately breached our floor price on big volume. \n\n\n\n\nThis increases the cost of our trade. People who did not get in yesterday will pay around $418 to do so. But the probability of a payoff probably increased by at least one-third.  So the trade is attractive as ever. \n\n\tThu Aug 3 2023\t\nDisclosure: Investing in options and crypto is inherently risky.

As some of you know, I follow ARKK very closely. Over the next 5 years I believe this will continue to move up enormously, though the road will be very much a roller coaster. I like to play it both to the long and the short side, using options. I'm bullish on ARKK from here, but not until it closes a recent gap. This should take place over the next 2-3 days, so I'm putting on the following broken wing butterfly trade that risks around $45 per position in order to make between $50 and $350 over the next 3 days.\n\nHere's my technical analysis showing you what I expect over the next few days:\n\nSupporting Graph\n\nDisclosure: Investing in options or crypto is inherently risky.
